## Outdoor Blog Frontend

## Technologies used:
- React

## About this project:
- When I first began coding, one of my main goals was to create a blog!
- I created this blog to share my experience with my hikes and outdoor activities.
- On the main page of this app, you are able to create a new blog post, where you are able to add a photo, a title, and details. Once pressing the submit button, the post will automatically show up at the top of the page. From there you can click the "read more" drop down, where you are able to then read about the post, edit the post, and delete the post as well. I used Bootstrap for React with the read more dropdown, the cards, and some of the buttons.

## Struggles:
- I ended up having to completely start my frontend over because I was getting lost in my code and things weren't working as I needed them to.
- I have a bug in this project where once you edit the information, you have to refresh the page to be able to edit the same one again.
- I also would have liked to have added user authentication for this project, but I was struggling with it on the backend, so I decided to remove that for now. The goal is to be able to be the only one to sign in and delete or edit my blog posts.
